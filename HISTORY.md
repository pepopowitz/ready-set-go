# Setting this thing up

I used a mish mash of resources to get started with this app.

1. Configured things from https://github.com/aisrael/elixir-phoenix-typescript-react

- Erlang
- Elixir
- Postgres via Docker Compose
- Hex
- Phoenix application generator

2. Set up a new phoenix/react app from https://blog.logrocket.com/to-do-list-phoenix-react-typescript/
